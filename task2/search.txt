   1: Display.

 Display is a CSS property that determines how an element is treated as a box and how it interacts with other boxes in the layout.
There are different values for display:
display: inline means the element generates one or more inline boxes that do not break the line before or after them. Inline elements can only have horizontal margins, padding, and borders, and they cannot have a specified width or height. Examples of inline elements are <span>, <a>, and <img>1.

display: inline-block means the element generates an inline-level block container. It is similar to inline, but it allows the element to have vertical margins, padding, and borders, and to have a specified width and height. Inline-block elements can also align themselves along the vertical axis using the vertical-align property1. Examples of inline-block elements are <button> and <input>1.

  2: ID selector.

The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element1.
